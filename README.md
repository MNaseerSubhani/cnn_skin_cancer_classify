# Skin cancer classifier using deep convolution neural network Keras implementation 

Melanoma skin cancer is a deadly type of skin cancer.it is very important to detect melanoma cancer at its early stage .at early stage 90% of melanoma, skin cancer can easily diagnosis. 

In this project we develop convolution neural network that can detect melanoma and non melanoma skin cancer as binary classifier.We used keras framework for implementation.

# Dataset
There is no dataset availabe for melanoma skin cancer at this date .but latter on may be it will available.we downloaded the data set from ISIC  : https://isic-archive.com/#images

We did pre proceesing of dataset before feed to the model.
